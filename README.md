# Strawn

Strawn is Moriatz Labs’ original variable typeface and the shared typographic voice across Moriatz products. Its letters are constructed from tapered vectors inspired by toothpicks: pointed at both ends, dense through the middle, and recognisable from interface labels to oversized headlines.
